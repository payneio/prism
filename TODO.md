# TODO

## Lib

- [ ] Update templates and move init code into lib from cli.
- [ ] Change .prism file to a .prism directory. Put backlinks.txt and tags.txt and .search in it.
- [ ] Prevent a prism from being created inside a prism. Maybe?
- [ ] Change create page params to start with filename, make it or the title
  mandatory, and allow filenames to be specified without the .md extension (and
  .md will be added if necessary).
- [ ] Make page move work.
- [ ] Update templates to have generators.
- [ ] Back indexes.
- [ ] Flatten.

## Cli

- [ ] When using prism, it should work from your current dir, not the root.
