## Upcoming

These items are generally in order of what will be delivered next.

- Fix page validation.
- The find-root-instantiate-prism pattern can be a decorator.
- Break up page functions into classes (cache, metadata, etc.)
- **Move page**: Make page move work.
- **Move folder**: Make page move work.
- **Back indexes**: Maintain back indexes for navigation.
- **Flatten**: Make a part of a prism a single md page. `prism flatten <page> --depth=2`
- **Re-root**: Make a given page the new root of a prism repo and restructure the entire thing.
- **Client working directory**: When using prism, it should work from your current dir, not the root.
- **Subprism prevention**: Prevent a prism from being created inside a prism. Maybe?
- **TOC Improvements**: Allow specifying depth in TOC generator.
