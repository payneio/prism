### **üì¶ Deliverables**

1. **Core Specification (Prism Format & Layout)**
   - Defines file structures, metadata, indexing formats, and generator standards.
   - Guidelines for maintaining structural integrity across implementations.

2. **Library Specification (For Implementers)**
   - A detailed spec outlining APIs, data models, and expected behaviors for libraries in different languages.
   - Covers key modules: content management, indexing (backlinks, tags, search), sync, and projections.

3. **Reference Libraries**
   - **Python Library (Primary Reference Implementation)**  
   - Additional language libraries (e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust) for broader adoption.
   - Consistent APIs across languages to ensure portability.

4. **API Specification (Optional Web API Layer)**
   - RESTful/GraphQL API for remote interactions, useful for browser extensions and hosted services.
   - Follows the same principles as the library specification to ensure consistency.

5. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
   - Built on top of the reference library (initially Python).
   - Acts as both a user-facing tool and a reference for library behaviors.

6. **Browser Extension (Prism Viewer)**
   - Leverages the JS/TypeScript library for content rendering, projections, and navigation.
   - Real-time interactions with local prisms or hosted APIs.

7. **Sync Layer**
   - Common sync logic abstracted for use across libraries.
   - Adapters for local filesystems, cloud storage, and remote APIs (SFTP, WebDAV, etc.).

8. **Indexing Engine (Core Functionality)**
   - Standardized indexing algorithms for backlinks, tags, and search.
   - Language-agnostic data formats to ensure interoperability across libraries.

### **üóÇÔ∏è Key Modules for Library Specification**

1. **Prism Core Module**
   - Prism initialization, validation, and structure management.
   - Page/folder operations: create, move, rename, delete.

2. **Indexing Module**
   - Backlink tracking, tag aggregation, full-text search.
   - Incremental indexing for performance optimization.

3. **Generator Module**
   - API for dynamic content generation.
   - Extensibility model for custom generators.

4. **Projection Module**
   - Logic for creating sub-prisms, flattened views, and contextual summaries.

5. **Sync Module**
   - Interfaces for local and remote synchronization.
   - Conflict detection and resolution strategies.

### **üìã Library Specification Outline**

#### **1. API Design Principles**

- Consistent naming conventions across languages.
- Async-first design where applicable.
- Clear error handling with standardized exceptions.

#### **2. Data Structures**

- Unified models for nodes, metadata, and indexes.
- JSON/YAML as common serialization formats.

#### **3. Extensibility**

- Plugin architecture for adding custom generators or sync adapters.
- Hooks for real-time integrations.

#### **4. Compliance Requirements**

- Test suites for validating library implementations.
- Versioning policy to manage updates and compatibility.
