## Overview

The Prism Sync Specification defines the protocols, data structures, and operational guidelines for synchronizing Prism data across local devices, remote servers, and cloud providers. This specification supports reliable data consistency, conflict resolution, and seamless collaboration across multiple environments.

## 1. Design Principles

- **Consistency:** Ensures data integrity across different devices and environments.
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple sync backends, including local file systems, SFTP, WebDAV, and cloud storage.
- **Conflict Management:** Built-in strategies for conflict detection and resolution.
- **Efficiency:** Optimizes for minimal data transfer and fast synchronization.
- **Security:** Secure data transmission and storage through encryption.

## 2. Sync Architecture

### 2.1 Components

- **Sync Engine:** Core logic responsible for detecting changes, managing conflicts, and executing sync operations.
- **Sync Adapter:** Interface for different sync backends (e.g., SFTP, WebDAV, cloud APIs).
- **Conflict Resolver:** Module for handling conflicting changes.
- **Change Tracker:** Monitors modifications in Prism content for incremental syncing.

### 2.2 Data Flow

1. **Change Detection:** Identify modified files and metadata.
2. **Conflict Check:** Compare changes with the remote source.
3. **Data Transfer:** Synchronize updated files, indexes, and metadata.
4. **Conflict Resolution:** Resolve discrepancies based on defined strategies.
5. **Confirmation:** Finalize sync and update status logs.

## 3. Supported Sync Methods

- **Local Sync:** File system-based synchronization (e.g., Git integration).
- **Remote Sync:** Via SFTP, WebDAV, or custom remote APIs.
- **Cloud Sync:** Integration with services like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
- **P2P Sync (Future):** Decentralized, peer-to-peer synchronization.

## 4. Sync API

### 4.1 Start Sync

- **POST** `/sync/start`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "method": "sftp",
  "remote_url": "sftp://example.com/prism",
  "credentials": {
    "username": "user",
    "password": "securepass"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "sync_in_progress",
  "sync_id": "sync-12345"
}
```

### 4.2 Get Sync Status

- **GET** `/sync/status/{sync_id}`

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "last_synced_at": "2025-02-09T16:00:00Z",
  "conflicts": []
}
```

### 4.3 Resolve Sync Conflict

- **POST** `/sync/resolve`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "conflict_id": "conflict-5678",
  "resolution_strategy": "keep_local"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "resolved",
  "resolved_at": "2025-02-09T17:00:00Z"
}
```

## 5. Conflict Detection & Resolution

### 5.1 Conflict Scenarios

- **Simultaneous Edits:** Changes made to the same file on different devices.
- **Deletion Conflicts:** One device deletes a file that another device modified.
- **Structural Changes:** Folder renaming or file movements causing path mismatches.

### 5.2 Conflict Resolution Strategies

- **Manual Merge:** Prompt user to manually resolve the conflict.
- **Keep Local:** Prioritize the local version.
- **Keep Remote:** Prioritize the remote version.
- **Auto-Merge:** Attempt automated merging for text files (where feasible).

### 5.3 Conflict Metadata Format

```json
{
  "conflict_id": "conflict-5678",
  "file_path": "docs/page.md",
  "local_version": {
    "hash": "abc123",
    "modified_at": "2025-02-09T12:00:00Z"
  },
  "remote_version": {
    "hash": "def456",
    "modified_at": "2025-02-09T13:00:00Z"
  },
  "status": "unresolved"
}
```

## 6. Change Tracking

The **Change Tracker** monitors file system events or uses checksums to detect modifications.

### 6.1 Change Types

- **Created:** New files or folders added.
- **Modified:** Changes to existing content.
- **Deleted:** Removal of files or folders.
- **Moved/Renamed:** Structural changes.

### 6.2 Change Log Format

```json
{
  "changes": [
    {
      "type": "modified",
      "path": "docs/page.md",
      "timestamp": "2025-02-09T12:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "type": "deleted",
      "path": "old_docs/obsolete.md",
      "timestamp": "2025-02-09T11:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 7. Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption:** TLS for data in transit; optional end-to-end encryption for sensitive content.
- **Authentication:** Token-based authentication (JWT) for API access.
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions for multi-user environments.

## 8. Performance Optimization

- **Incremental Sync:** Only transfers changed files to reduce bandwidth.
- **Parallel Transfers:** Supports concurrent file uploads/downloads.
- **Compression:** Optional data compression for faster sync.

## 9. Error Handling

Standardized error responses:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "409",
    "message": "Conflict detected",
    "details": "Simultaneous modification detected in docs/page.md."
  }
}
```

## 10. Versioning

Sync protocol versioning ensures compatibility across clients:

- **Major:** Breaking changes.
- **Minor:** New features, backward-compatible.
- **Patch:** Bug fixes, backward-compatible.

## Conclusion

The Prism Sync Specification ensures reliable, secure, and efficient data synchronization across diverse environments, supporting both individual workflows and collaborative use cases.
