A next-generation content management protocol designed for an AI-enabled future.
Prism lets you create, organize, and transform markdown-based content with
powerful projection and summarization capabilities.

## Core Features

- **Structured Wiki**: Create markdown-based wikis with guaranteed structural
  integrity
- **Content Generators**: Automatically generate and maintain tables of
  contents, sibling pages, directory listings, and more
- **Smart Projections**: Extract focused subsets of your content for specific
  purposes
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Generate summaries from different perspectives,
  intelligently walking the content graph
- **Tag-Based Organization**: Flexible tagging system with automatic index
  maintenance
- **Command Line Interface**: Full control through a powerful CLI

## Why Prism?

Traditional content management systems weren't built for the AI age. Prism represents a new approach, where content isn't just stored and retrieved, but can be dynamically transformed, projected, and rewritten based on specific needs.

Think of Prism as a protocol more than a tool - it defines how content should be structured and linked to enable powerful transformations. While this implementation provides a CLI and Python library, the protocol is designed to be implemented across many tools and platforms.
