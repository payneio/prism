## Prism

Prism reimagines content management for the AI era by transforming static
information into dynamic, adaptable knowledge. While tools like Notion and
Obsidian offer rich features for organizing notes and documents, they largely
remain passive repositories. They require manual effort to restructure or
repurpose content for different contexts.

**The Heart of Prism** lies in its ability to make content inherently flexible
and interactive:

- **Dynamic Content Transformation**: Prism treats your content as a living
  graph, not just a collection of files. You can project, transform, and reshape
  information on-the-fly, tailoring it to specific needs without duplicating or
  manually reorganizing it.

- **Seamless AI Integration**: Designed with AI collaboration in mind, Prism
  allows AI assistants to navigate, summarize, and even help build your content
  structures. This means you can leverage AI to manage context, generate
  insights, and maintain your knowledge base effortlessly.

- **Markdown Simplicity with Graph Power**: By building on Markdown, Prism keeps
  things simple and accessible. Yet, beneath that simplicity is a powerful
  graph-based system that enables sophisticated organization and retrieval of
  information.

- **Open, Flexible, and Collaborative**: Prism is protocol-first and
  git-friendly, promoting openness and interoperability. You're not locked into
  specific tools or platforms, allowing for broader collaboration and longevity
  of your content.

**Why This Matters**:

Traditional systems and even newer applications focus on storing information,
but they don't inherently support the dynamic needs of modern knowledge work,
especially in collaboration with AI. Prism addresses this gap by:

- Eliminating the need for manual maintenance of complex content structures.
- Enabling real-time content adaptation and projection for different contexts or
  audiences.
- Harnessing AI to enhance and manage your content, turning a passive repository
  into an active knowledge partner.

In essence, Prism offers a paradigm shift from static documents to dynamic
knowledge ecosystems, bridging the gap between human thought and AI
capabilities. It's a powerful innovation because it doesn't just manage
informationâ€”it transforms how we interact with knowledge itself.

## Benefits

- An AI assistant can build a purpose-built prism on your behalf or in
  collaboration with you.
- You can snapshot/fork/project/a prism to provide context to an AI assistant.
- Many systems can interface with a powerful general-purpose text-based content
  management system.
- Markdown is ubiquitous and simple.
- A prism acts as a knowledge graph/graph db, so it can be used to create
  projections/sub-graphs.
- An idea like this has been useful in the past, but required power-users
  (librarians) to really maintain them. Now that LLMs are everywhere, though,
  this system can be used as the backend to an LLM assistant giving it
  exceptional context-management capabilities. Context can be searched and
  assembled (projected/summarized) on the fly.
- Git-friendly (good for openness).
- Editor agnostic. Reader agnostic (may consider creating mobile clients).

## Core Features

- **Structured Wiki**: Create markdown-based wikis with guaranteed structural
  integrity
- **Content Generators**: Automatically generate and maintain tables of
  contents, sibling pages, directory listings, and more
- **Smart Projections**: Extract focused subsets of your content for specific
  purposes
- **AI-Powered Summarization**: Generate summaries from different perspectives,
  intelligently walking the content graph
- **Tag-Based Organization**: Flexible tagging system with automatic index
  maintenance
- **Command Line Interface**: Full control through a powerful CLI
