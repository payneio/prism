## Overview

The **Prism System Architecture** defines the structural blueprint for how different components of Prism interact to manage, transform, and synchronize knowledge effectively. The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and protocol-driven, enabling seamless integration across diverse platforms while maintaining simplicity for individual users and scalability for collaborative environments.

---

## 1. Design Principles

- **Modularity:** Components are decoupled, allowing independent development, testing, and deployment.
- **Extensibility:** Supports plugins and protocol extensions to add new features without modifying core components.
- **Interoperability:** Libraries and APIs follow a consistent specification, enabling integration across different languages and platforms.
- **Decentralization:** No reliance on a central server; supports local-first workflows with optional remote sync.
- **Resilience:** Handles conflicts, data consistency, and synchronization efficiently, even in distributed environments.

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 Prism Core Libraries

The **Prism Core Libraries** are the primary implementation of the Prism Protocol in various languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust, etc.). They provide APIs for:

- **Content Management:** Create, update, move, and delete pages and folders.
- **Indexing:** Maintain backlinks, tags, search indexes, and metadata.
- **Generators:** Dynamically generate content (TOCs, backlinks, projections).
- **Projections:** Create sub-prisms, summaries, or flattened views.
- **Synchronization:** Interface with local filesystems and remote storage.

### 3.2 User Interfaces

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

- Built on top of the core library.
- Provides commands for page/folder management, projections, indexing, and sync.

#### Browser Extension

- Uses the JavaScript core library for rendering, navigation, and light editing.
- Supports on-the-fly projections and real-time collaboration via API.

#### Mobile/Desktop Apps (Future)

- Lightweight clients focused on reading, note-taking, and offline sync.

### 3.3 Data Management & Synchronization Layer

- **Local Filesystem (Default):** Uses markdown files with metadata and `.prism` directories for indexes.
- **Git Integration:** Optional version control for content and metadata.
- **Remote Sync Adapters:** Interfaces for SFTP, WebDAV, and cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.

---

## 4. Indexing Engine

Responsible for maintaining:

- **Backlinks:** Tracks inbound links between pages.
- **Tag Index:** Maps tags to nodes.
- **Search Index:** Enables full-text search across content.
- **Metadata Index:** Stores structured metadata for efficient querying.

The indexing engine updates automatically during content modifications or via explicit refresh commands.

---

## 5. Synchronization Workflow

1. **Local Changes:**  
   - User edits content via CLI, browser extension, or directly in the filesystem.
   - Indexes are updated incrementally.

2. **Sync Trigger:**  
   - Manual (`prism sync start`) or automated trigger based on file changes.

3. **Conflict Detection:**  
   - Prism compares file hashes, timestamps, and metadata to detect conflicts.

4. **Conflict Resolution:**  
   - Strategies include automatic merging, user prompts, or custom conflict handlers via plugins.

5. **Remote Update:**  
   - Changes are pushed to remote storage or pulled for local updates.

---

## 6. Plugin & Extension Architecture

- **Core Plugins:** Built-in generators (TOCs, backlinks, summaries).
- **Custom Plugins:** Third-party or user-defined extensions for new generators, sync strategies, or data processors.
- **Protocol Extensions:** Define new API endpoints or data formats without altering core components.

---

## 7. Data Model & Storage

- **Markdown Files:** Primary content format with YAML front-matter for metadata.
- **`.prism/` Directory:** Contains:
  - `backlinks.txt`
  - `tags.txt`
  - `.search/index.json`
  - `metadata.json`

- **Projections & Snapshots:** Stored as either dynamic views or static exports.

---

## 8. API Integration

The Prism API (REST/GraphQL) is available for:

- Remote content management (via Prism Host or self-hosted servers).
- Real-time collaboration (WebSockets for live updates).
- External integrations (third-party apps, automation scripts).

---

## 9. Security Considerations

- **Authentication:** Token-based (JWT) for APIs.
- **Encryption:** Optional for local storage, recommended for remote sync.
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions for shared prisms.

---

## 10. Future Considerations

- **Federated Knowledge Networks:** Linking multiple prisms across devices or organizations.
- **Decentralized Sync:** P2P protocols for direct device-to-device synchronization.
- **Semantic Indexing:** Advanced AI-driven metadata extraction for deeper content insights.
